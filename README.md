# 👋 Hi, I'm pg-goose

## About Me
Currently, I'm a Software Engineering student who dove head-first into real-world development when Piveu offered me the chance to join their project mid course. Since then, I've helped iterate our solution into an on-site IoT platform specialized for operating rooms.

Therefore, I'm a Fullstack Engineer at **Piveu Medtech Solutions**, where I develop every part of our core product. From frontend and backend to hardware, firmware, architecture, and even CI/CD pipelines. Though our project is private, I'm happy to provide a contact reference for interested employers*.

As the project enters its handoff phase, I’m finalizing deliverables, documenting systems, and supporting knowledge transfer to ensure a smooth transition. With this milestone, I’m actively exploring my next step, a career change to embeeded programing. Ideally, I’m seeking an internship arranged under an **internship agreement** with my university, where I can contribute immediately while aligning the role with my academic program. If that sounds like a fit, I’d love to connect.
