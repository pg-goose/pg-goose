# 👋 Hey, call me _pg-goose_

## Me

- I believe in free/libre software and I’m keen to start contributing, first issues coming soon.
- Early stage and exploring my lane. Embedded programming 🤖 is what keeps me curious.
- I fell for Go’s simplicity and minimalism. Now I’m a fan of the language, its philosophy, and ecosystem.
- Thanks to university projects and hackathons I’ve touched many stacks, and I learn deeply and quickly when needed.
- Motorbike rider and indoor climbing enjoyer.

## 📚 My History

I’m a Software Engineering student who dove head-first into real-world development when Piveu invited me to join mid-course. Since then, I’ve helped evolve an on-premise IoT platform for operating rooms. I work as a Full-stack Engineer at **Piveu Medtech Solutions**, contributing across the stack: frontend, backend, hardware, firmware, architecture, and CI/CD. The project is private, but I’m happy to share a contact reference with interested employers. As we enter the handoff phase, I’m finalizing deliverables, documenting systems, and supporting knowledge transfer to ensure a smooth transition.

I’m now exploring my next step: moving into **embedded programming**.

## 🛠️ Recent skills

- **Go**
- **Docker**
- **Python**
- **SQL**
- **SvelteKit** (TypeScript, CSS, HTML)
- CI/CD, firmware basics, and more

## 🪿 Now

Curating my portfolio and scraping the 🦀 rust off my C while I steer toward low-level embedded work. I’ll be spending the next few months on hands-on C and dipping my toes on embedded programming.
